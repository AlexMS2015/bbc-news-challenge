## Problem Statement

Build a multi-class classifier on the [BBC News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/bbc-news), consisting of ~2,000 articles across five topics: business, entertainment, politics, sports, and tech.

The goal is to correctly classify each article into one of these topics. This is framed as a 5-class classification task.


## Approach

### 1. Design Overview

- EDA (see `/src/notebooks/eda.ipynb`) revealed:
  - All text is lowercase with little punctuation.
  - Classes are well balanced.
  - 80% of articles have ≤20 unique words.
  - Top words are distinct per topic, suggesting simple models may perform well.

- **Three models** were trained to compare performance:
  
| Model     | Feature Extraction      | Classifier           | Hyperparameter Tuning         | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Baseline  | TF-IDF (1k vocab, stopwords removed) | Logistic Regression   | No                            | 0.96     | 0.96     |
| Model 2   | Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) | Logistic Regression   | No                            | 0.98     | 0.98     |
| Model 3   | Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)   | XGBoost               | 100 trials (random CV)        | 0.96     | 0.96     |


- **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**: A strong, interpretable baseline requiring no tuning.
- **Sentence Transformers**: Used for richer semantic embeddings. Improved performance and generalization.
- **XGBoost**: Tried for non-linear modeling, but offered no significant gain over logistic regression.

- **Metric Choice**:
  - **Accuracy** is appropriate due to balanced classes.
  - **Weighted F1** is also reported to account for label-specific precision/recall.

## Error Analysis

- **UMAP** plots show that misclassified points lie further from their true topic clusters.
- **Confidence plots** (max predicted probability) reveal that errors tend to occur at low confidence.
- **Confusion matrix** shows most errors are semantic overlaps:
  - _Business_ vs _Politics_: “education”, “government”, “health”
  - _Tech_ vs _Entertainment_: “popular”, “awards”
- **LIME** was attempted to interpret transformer-based predictions but was less effective due to embeddings not being token-based. This is not included in the final pipeline as it is slow and adds little value.

📊 _Suggested diagrams to include_ (optional but valuable):
- Confusion matrix
- UMAP projection with errors highlighted
- Confidence KDE plot (correct vs incorrect)

## Reproducibility

### Dockerized Pipeline

Model 2 (Sentence Transformers + Logistic Regression) was productionized.

- To train and evaluate, run the following from the **root project directory**:

```bash
make run-docker
```
- This runs `src/pipeline.py` inside Docker using configuration from `src/config.py` (and `config.yaml`).
- All results are saved **locally** to the `artifacts/` directory, including metrics, plots, and model files.
- Logs are saved to `artifacts/app.log` **locally**.

### Local Usage
- Additional `make` commands are available to lint, test and run the code locally.
- To run notebooks, run the below commands and then open the notebook with the “BBC News” kernel:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv bbc-env
	./bbc-env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=bbc-news --display-name "BBC News"
    ```

## Future Improvements

### Model
- Fine-tune BERT (e.g., unfrozen classification head and other layers) for potentially higher performance.
- Improve TF-IDF preprocessing: try bigrams, lemmatization (e.g., via spaCy).

### Pipeline
- Add inference pipeline or API.
- Add MLflow for experiment tracking.
- Add pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement.
